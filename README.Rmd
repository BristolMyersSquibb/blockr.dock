## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.dock from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.dock")
```

## Example

To start up a board for visualizing `Sepal.Length` against `Sepal.Width` for the `iris` dataset, we can run

```r
library(blockr.dock)
serve(
  new_dock_board(
    blocks = c(
      a = new_dataset_block("iris"),
      b = new_scatter_block(x = "Sepal.Length", y = "Sepal.Width")
    ),
    links = list(from = "a", to = "b", input = "data")
  )
)
```

This is a read-only view of this board, as no blocks can be added or removed and block connectivity cannot be changed. We can however change parameters for the input data and visualization.
